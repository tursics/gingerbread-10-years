## history

Back in 2015 I developed a first version in a 10 weeks hackathon. The [source code](https://github.com/tursics/GingerbreadGame) and a [playable demo](https://tursics.de/sample/gingerbread/) are still available.

Back to 2025 I started from scratch. The first version only use the console of browser.

The next iteration step displays the content on the browser canvas.
