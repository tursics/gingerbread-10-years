# 003 - Change game name to **Lebkuchenzauber** or **Gingerbread Magic**

## Context and Problem Statement

The first version of the game was developed 10 years ago at a hackathon under the name "Nürnberger Lebkuchen" ("Nuremberg gingerbread"). The name is being reviewed.

### Advantages

* **Authenticity and Quality:** The name exudes authenticity, tradition, and a certain craftsmanship. It stands out from generic "candy" or "cookie" names.
* **Recognition (in German-speaking countries):** In Germany and neighboring regions, people immediately know what is meant and associate it with a special treat.
* **Nostalgia:** Many have positive childhood memories of Nuremberg gingerbread.

### Disadvantages / Challenges

* **International Comprehensibility:** Outside of German-speaking countries, "Nuremberg gingerbread" may not be immediately understandable. "Lebkuchen" is familiar to many, but "Nuremberg" as a specific origin could cause confusion or make it difficult to associate.
* **Pronunciation:** For non-native speakers, pronunciation could be a hurdle.
* **Association with a product:** It sounds more like a real food than a mobile game. This could initially put off the target audience looking for a "sweet" and "playful" game.
* **Licensing/Trademark Rights:** "Nürnberger Lebkuchen" is a protected geographical indication. Legal challenges could arise if the name is used commercially for a game that is not directly affiliated with the Nuremberg-based manufacturers or meets their criteria. This is an important point that should definitely be examined.

## Considered Options

I would suggest finding a name that captures the essence of gingerbread, but is more universally understandable and sounds more playful.

### Focus on the core "gingerbread"

* **Gingerbread Saga:** A direct reference to Candy Crush, it immediately signals the game genre and uses the central term. "Gingerbread" is easily understood internationally.
* **Lebkuchen Land:** Sounds like a world waiting to be discovered and fits the map view.
* **Sweet Gingerbread:** Emphasizes sweetness and playfulness.
* **Gingerbread Kingdom:** Gives the game an epic, fairytale feel.
* **Cookie Crumble:** A playful alliteration that captures the "match-3" aspect (crumbling). "Cookie" is very well-known internationally, and gingerbread is a type of cookie.

### Combination with the specific Nuremberg charm (if licensing is not a problem and the focus is on the German market)

* **Nuremberg Lebkuchen World:** Adds "World" to emphasize the gaming aspect.
* **Lebkuchen Match: Nuremberg Edition:** Emphasizes the gameplay and makes the Nuremberg connection a special version.

### Suggestions for titles with a fairy tale reference

The reference to German fairy tales fits perfectly with the gingerbread theme and gives the game a very special, magical touch. It's much more charming than the generic "Saga."

The most well-known reference is, of course, the gingerbread house from Hansel and Gretel. This story is known worldwide and ideally serves as a narrative thread for the game.

* **Lebkuchen-Märchen** -> **Gingerbread Fairy Tale**
* **Das große Lebkuchen-Abenteuer** -> **The Great Gingerbread Adventure**
* **Märchenhafter Lebkuchen-Pfad** -> **Fairytale Gingerbread Trail**
* **Zauberhafte Lebkuchen-Welt** -> **Magical Gingerbread World**
* **Knusper-Rätsel** -> **Crunchy Puzzle**, **Cookie Crumble** or **Gingerbread Puzzle**
* **Zuckerwald-Zauber** -> **Sugar Forest Magic** or **Sugarwood Magic**
* **Lebkuchenzauber** -> **Gingerbread Magic**

A title with a fairy tale theme is ideal for adapting to different languages. This would retain the cultural flavor while remaining understandable to an international audience. Well, short and concise titles are often the best for mobile games because they are memorable and perform well in app stores. They are short, sound playful, and perfectly capture the magical, fairytale atmosphere without committing to a specific story.

## Decision Outcome

The name **Lebkuchenzauber** opens the door to exploring not just one, but many fairytale worlds. Each fairytale could be its own "map" or chapter of the game.

### Consequences

* Good is if the name of the game is also part of the repository path
* Bad is that the path is subsequently changed
