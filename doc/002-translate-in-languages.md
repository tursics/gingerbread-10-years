# 002 - Game will be translated into several languages

## Context and Problem Statement

The game is being developed in Germany with a German theme. It's being programmed in English. It's therefore only logical that the game will also be translated into several languages. The question is which languages ​​make sense, now and in the future.

## Decision Drivers

Choosing the right languages ​​is a crucial step in making a game globally successful. Since this is a casual game intended to appeal to a broad audience, broad availability makes sense. The text is minimal, so translation costs are relatively low.

Here's a recommendation, broken down by priority:

### Priority 1: Essential for Launch

These languages ​​cover the largest and highest-revenue markets. They allow you to reach a large portion of potential players worldwide.

* **English:** The global lingua franca. Absolutely essential for North America, the UK, and the default in almost all app stores.
* **Spanish:** One of the most spoken languages ​​in the world, tapping into a huge market in Spain and throughout Latin America.
* **Portuguese (Brazil):** Brazil is a very large and rapidly growing market for mobile games. The Brazilian variant of Portuguese is important here.
* **German:** A very high-revenue market in Central Europe, attracted to casual games like this one.
* **French:** Important for the European market and also for players in parts of Canada and Africa.
* **Japanese & Korean:** Although the markets are smaller, players there are highly engaged and, on average, spend a lot of money on games.

### Priority 2: Highly recommended for further expansion

These languages ​​are ideal for establishing the game in key regional markets once the initial version is successful.

* **Simplified Chinese:** China is the largest games market in the world. Localization is more complex here, but the potential is enormous.
* **Russian:** A large, unified market with a very active player base.
* **Italian & Turkish:** Important markets in Europe and the MENA (Middle East & North Africa) region that have a lot of potential.

By introducing these languages ​​in phases, you can control costs while ensuring your game reaches its maximum audience.

## Considered Options

* English and German
* see above plus Spanish, Brazil, French, Japanese and Korean (Priority 1)
* see above plus Chinese, Russian, Italian and Turkish (Priority 2)

## Decision Outcome

We'll start with the **English and German** options. Both languages ​​are easy to test and match the developer's skills.

### Consequences

* Good because multilingualism can be implemented more complexly at a later date.
* Good because the choice of font can be made more consciously, as umlauts, for example, must be able to be used.

## More Information

Consideration should be given to the feasibility of using a collaborative online tool for i18n. This could invite the community to develop and maintain additional language packs.
